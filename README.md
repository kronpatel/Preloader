Readme

This code is a simple HTML page that contains a progress bar animation implemented with jQuery. The progress bar animation is designed to fill up as each element in the HTML document is loaded.
Files

    index.html: This is the main HTML file that contains the progress bar animation.
    main.css: This file contains the CSS styling for the HTML elements.
    Jquery-1.10.2.min.js: This is the jQuery library file that is used to implement the progress bar animation.

How it Works

The progress bar animation is triggered when the document is in the interactive state, which means that the HTML has been loaded and the DOM is ready. The code then loops through all the elements in the HTML document using jQuery and sets the width of the progress bar based on the number of elements that have been loaded.

As each element is loaded, the progress bar fills up accordingly. When the progress bar reaches 100%, the .main element fades out, indicating that the page has finished loading.
